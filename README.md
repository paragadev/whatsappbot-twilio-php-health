The healthcare industry is under immense pressure for over past few years and needs to embrace digital transformation to scale up and provide equitable healthcare access. There is no other better channel than **WhatsApp** in delivering equitable access to healthcare, an app which is most widely used across the planet. By deploying WhatsApp chatbots for healthcare we could do following:

**Booking appointment**

Patients can book appointment video/in-person with doctor of respective department from available schedule without having the need of visiting hospital and spend time at registration desk. In case of video appointment, there is no need to visit hospital at all for first consultation. Popular platforms such as WhatsApp video can be used for remote consultation.

**Odd hour support**

With the help of WhatsApp Bot provided hospital supports availability of doctors during odd hours, quick remote consultation can be setup with just a ping in a most natural way. No need to download any app.

**Uploading documents**

Users can use WhatsApp bot to send necessary documents directly over the bot instead of having to email care providers, eventually building health history at every possible interaction thus reducing the fear and eliminating the consequences of having left their documents at home, which leads to higher levels of customer satisfaction.

**Important reminders**

Such as, appointment reminders, medicine reminders, food and exercise schedule to users in a most seamless manner.

**Sharing digital copies of health records**

Such as, prescriptions, bills, reports etc.. digitally. They can be accessed by patients at any time by simply issuing a command to the bot.

**Making payments**

Waiting in line at a hospital to book medical consultations and pay for them can be quite annoying. Post online registration and appointment, payments can also be done in a seamless manner over WhatsApp Bot.
